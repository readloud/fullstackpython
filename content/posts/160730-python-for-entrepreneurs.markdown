[Python for Entrepreneurs](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-for-entrepreneurs-video-course)
is a new video course by the creators of 
[Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) and 
[Full Stack Python](https://fullstackpython.com/).

*Update*: The Kickstarter has been funded! Michael and I are hard 
at work on the course content. Thank you to everyone who supported 
us as a backer. The course is available in early access mode on
[training.talkpython.fm](https://training.talkpython.fm) until it
is fully released.

We are creating this course and running a Kickstarter for it based on 
feedback that it's still too damn difficult to turn basic Python programming 
knowledge into a business to generate income as a side or full time project. 
Both Michael and I have been able to make that happen for ourselves and we 
want to share every difficult lesson we've learned through this course.

The Python for Entrepreneurs videos and content will dive into building 
and deploying a real-world web application, marketing it to prospective 
customers, handling search engine optimization, making money through credit 
card payments, getting help from part-time contractors for niche tasks and 
scaling up to meet traffic demands.

If this course hits the mark for what you want to do with Python,
[check out the Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-for-entrepreneurs-video-course) - we've 
set up steep discounts for early backers.
