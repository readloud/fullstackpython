Check out the just-launched video course, 
[Introduction to Ansible](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_ansible/introduction-to-ansible-with-python)
on
[Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/). This is the
perfect course for you if you want to
learn to configure servers and deploy web apps with the 
[Ansible configuration management tool](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

My approach in this course is in less than 3 hours to teach you the core
concepts then get a ton of hands-on time creating Ansible Playbooks and
learning modules for practical applications. I also show you the errors
I frequently run into when using Ansible and how to fix them rather than
only showing the happy path.

Now that this course has been published I'll be turning my attention back
to the Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments book update that uses
the latest version of Ansible, Python 3 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. More news
about the update coming as soon as possible. In addition, the Ansible
course pairs very well with the deployments book as they use the same
tools but give a different angle on how to learn and use them.
