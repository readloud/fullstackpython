There are a bunch of 
[new tutorials](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog.html)
on [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) that were written
since the last time I sent out an email newsletter. These range from getting 
started with some popular open source projects to integrating third party 
APIs to build authentication into Flask applications:

* [Configure Python 3, Flask and Gunicorn on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/python-3-flask-gunicorn-ubuntu-1804-bionic-beaver.html)
  shows you how to set up your Python and 
  [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) 
  [development environment](https://www.fullstackpython.com/development-environments.html)
  on the latest [Ubuntu](https://www.fullstackpython.com/ubuntu.html)
  Long-Term Support (LTS) release.

* [How to Add User Authentication to Flask Apps with Okta](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/add-user-authentication-flask-apps-okta.html)
  covers using OpenID Connect and the Okta API in Flask applications
  to handle user authentication.

* [How to Provision Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Linux Servers on DigitalOcean](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/provision-ubuntu-1804-linux-servers-digitalocean.html)
  is a quick tutorial for developers who have not seen how easy it is
  to spin up a virtual private server on DigitalOcean for hosting
  their Python applications.

* [Running Bottle Apps in Docker Containers on macOS](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/first-steps-bottle-web-apps-docker-containers.html)
  provides just the basics to start using 
  [Docker](https://www.fullstackpython.com/docker.html) on macOS
  to run an example Flask web app.

* [How to Explain Your Products to Developers](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/explain-products-developers.html)
  is based on a talk I gave to a group of technical founders and investors
  in Silicon Valley. It's a bit different from my usual step-by-step 
  tutorial in that it gives strong advice based on my experience rather
  than show how to use an open source project or integrate a third-party
  API.
