[**DevOps, Continuous Delivery... and You**](/blog/devops-continuous-delivery-you.html)
is a blog post with the slides and notes based on a class I taught at
the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) this past week. The
talk is relevant as a brief introduction to 
[DevOps](/devops.html) and Continuous Delivery, 
especially for junior developers and less-technical managers of software 
teams. I'm experimenting with the "talk as blog post" style so let me know 
via email or a tweet if you enjoy it and would want to see future technical 
talks in that format.

Speaking of feedback on projects, 
[this GitHub issue thread named "**thank you**"](https://github.com/jhund/filterrific/issues/147#issuecomment-341867147)
is incredible to read. The issue ticket blew up on the front page of Hacker
News as an example of how powerful genuine positive comments can be for 
project maintainers.

[**Contributing to open source**](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/132/contributing-to-open-source) 
is a recent [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) podcast episode in 
the same vein as thanking your maintainer. Working on open source projects
with your own contributions to documentation or simple bug fixes can be a
great way to become a better programmer. I particularly enjoyed the 
recommendations of the panel to cut your teeth on smaller open source projects
rather than trying to jump into a massive codebase like 
[Django](https://github.com/django/django) or the 
[CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) implementation. Take a listen
to that podcast episode if you are new to open source or have been wondering
how to get involved.

As always, send me an email or [submit an issue ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/issues) 
to let me know how to improve 
[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) 
as I continue to 
[fill in the table of contents](/table-of-contents.html) 
with [new pages](/change-log.html)
and 
[new tutorials](/blog.html).
