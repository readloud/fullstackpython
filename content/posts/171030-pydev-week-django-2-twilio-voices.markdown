[**PyDev of the Week**](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/category/pydevoftheweek/) 
is a developer interview series by 
[Mike Driscoll](https://github.com/driscollis) that asks Python programmers 
how they started coding, the projects they're working on and what advice
they have for beginners. Mike was kind enough to 
[interview me in the latest PyDev of the Week post](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2017/10/30/pydev-of-the-week-matthew-makai/).

In the PyDev interview I gave a big shoutout to the fine folks working on the
[Django project](/django.html), which is 
currently beta testing the major upcoming
[**Django 2.0 release**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/2.0/).
Django 2.0 is the first release to support only Python 3, specifically 
[Python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/2.0/#python-compatibility). 
The [Django 2.0 beta 1 release](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2017/oct/16/django-20-beta-1-released/) 
needs
[feedback on bugs in the issue tracker](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?version=2.0&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=component&col=version&desc=1&order=id).

One bit I missed calling out in the PyDev interview is a new program I'm 
working on called [**Twilio Voices**](http://www.twiliovoices.com). Twilio
Voices pays developers to write great technical tutorials for the 
[Twilio blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog). We have already published a slew 
of awesome Python walkthroughs such as:
