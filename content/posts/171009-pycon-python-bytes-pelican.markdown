headeralt: PyCon US 2018 Call for Proposals now open, the awesome Python Bytes and using Pelican to generate static sites.


[**PyCon US 2018**](https://us.pycon.org/2018/) is coming up in Cleveland, Ohio
on May 9th-17th. The 
[call for proposals (CFP)](https://us.pycon.org/2018/speaking/talks/) 
went live in the past few days so now is the time to sharpen your keyboards 
and get yourself into the proposal writing zone. 

When you start working on your proposal, here are some awesome resources 
on building a great tech talk, public speaking and describing your session
by writing a solid proposal:

Looking forward to seeing you all at PyCon US in Cleveland early next year!


Speaking of folks who will definitely be at PyCon, 
[**Python Bytes**](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is an awesome weekly Python
podcast by [Michael Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy) of 
[Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) and 
[Brian Okken](https://twitter.com/brianokken) of 
[Test and Code](http://testandcode.com/). Michael and Brian teamed up to
host and produce Python Bytes. I really enjoy listening to the rapid-fire 
discussion of several programming topics within a single podcast. 

Michael and Brian were kind enough to invite me on as a co-host for the
[38th episode "Hacking Classic Nintendo Games with Python"](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/38/hacking-classic-nintendo-games-with-python)
while Michael was on vacation. 
The [following episode "The new PyPI"](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/39/the-new-pypi) 
also had a great discussion of the 
[Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) page on Full Stack Python](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html).


One of the projects I talked about on the Python Bytes podcast episode that
I guest hosted is [**Pelican**](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), the
[static site generator](/static-site-generator.html) 
that turns [Markdown](/markdown.html) and some 
[Jinja templates](/jinja2.html) into the 
Full Stack Python site. Here are some additional tutorials and resources
to get started using Pelican if you've been meaning to build a static site 
yourself:

One last bit: [Python for Entrepreneurs](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business) 
is now fully released with all 20 hours of content. Got non-developer 
friends who wants you to build them an app? Send them the 
[Python for Entrepreneurs course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business) 
so they can stop bugging you and build it themselves :)
