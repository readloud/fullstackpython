[PyCon US 2018](https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/) kicked off today with the 
[first day of tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/tutorials/). I am
flying in tomorrow and will be there through the end of the 
weekend. If you're around, come by either the 
[Twilio booth](https://www.twilio.com/) or the community booth where the 
gang from [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/), 
[Real Python](https://realpython.com/), [PyBites](https://pybit.es/) and 
[Test & Code](http://testandcode.com/) will be hanging out. I will be 
at one of those two spots when I am not watching talks! I'd love your 
feedback on what I can improve on 
[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/). It's also great 
hearing your stories about how the site has helped you improve your 
development skills.

For those folks who can't make it to PyCon, I'll be tweeting the best stuff 
that I see throughout the conference via 
[@fullstackpython](https://twitter.com/fullstackpython). Likewise, if I miss 
something let me know on Twitter or via email so we can highlight it.

One quick update on the
[Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments book](https://www.deploypython.com/). 
I have a great update in the works that bumps to the latest versions of 
Ubuntu (now 18.04 LTS), Ansible 2.5.1 and Flask 1.0.2. It has been a long 
time coming and will be a free update to all existing purchasers. If you have
not bought the book yet, I recommend waiting until the update is out 
because the existing book's software versions are getting way too out of 
date to be useful to most projects.

Got questions or comments about 
[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/)? Send me an email or 
[submit an issue ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/issues) 
to let me know how to improve the site as I continue to fill in the 
[table of contents](https://www.fullstackpython.com/table-of-contents.html) 
with [new pages](https://www.fullstackpython.com/change-log.html) and 
[new tutorials](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog.html).
