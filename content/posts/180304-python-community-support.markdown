Congratulations to fellow Python developer 
[Mike Driscoll](https://github.com/driscollis) for his successful 
**[ReportLab: PDF Processing with Python Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/34257246/reportlab-pdf-processing-with-python/)** 
that just concluded with over double his funding goal.

I was excited to back Mike's project for a couple of reasons. First, I've
used [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/opensource/) on past projects 
and it is a handy library for working with PDFs. Second, it is super useful 
to have entire books written on niche Python code libraries such as ReportLab.

[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) will gladly back and 
spread the word about other awesome, legitimate Python community projects. Let 
me know via email (matthew.makai@gmail.com or mattmakai@fullstackguides.com) 
when you are getting ready to launch a Python project so I can help give a 
boost.

[Michael Kennedy](https://talkpython.fm/) and I know from our 
[own Kickstarter experience](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeckennedy/python-for-entrepreneurs-video-course) 
how much work goes into making these ideas come to fruition. It's a big 
confidence boost to have a community tailwind at your back and I am always 
happy to be part of that tailwind.
