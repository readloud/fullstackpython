[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) began 
[way back in December 2012](/change-log.html)
when I started writing the initial [deployment](/deployment.html), 
[server](/servers.html), [operating system](/operating-systems.html), 
[web server](/web-servers.html) and [WSGI server](/wsgi-servers.html) pages. 
The site has has broadly expanded out into a 
[many other subjects](/table-of-contents.html) outside the deployment 
topics I originally started this site to explain.

However, I frequently wanted to write a Python walkthrough that was not a
good fit for the page format I use for each topic. Many of those walkthroughs
became [Twilio blog posts](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/mmakai)
but not all of them were quite the right fit on there. I'll still write
more [Twilio](/twilio.html) tutorials, but this 
[Full Stack Python blog](/blog.html) is the spot for technical posts that 
fall outside the Twilio domain.

Let me know what you think and what tutorials you'd like to see in the 
future.
