meta: Localhost tunnels allow anyone with a tunneling URL to connect to a server running on your local development system.


A localhost tunnel establishes a connection between your local machine
and a remote connection. The connection is intended to proxy traffic 
from a publicly-addressable IP address and URL to your local machine.
Localhost tunnels are most useful for allowing a tester to connect 
to a server running on your local development system so they can try
out an in-development application you are building but have not yet
[deployed](/deployment.html).


### Localhost tunnel services
There are numerous localhost tunnel services that have similar features.
The following services are listed in order from ones I have had the most 
experience with to the ones I have not used.

* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is the service I use most often. It is
  easy and worth the small fee to upgrade your account with a few
  extra features such as fixed, customizable subdomains. There is
  also a 
  [Python wrapper for ngrok called pyngrok](https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok)
  that makes it easy to programmatically access the ngrok client
  from Python applications.

* [Localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) is a localhost
  tunnel written in Node.js.

* [Burrow](https://burrow.io/) provides another service, albeit one
  that I have not used myself.
