meta: Terminal multiplexers can run several shells in a single terminal as well as attach, detach and move sessions from one computer to another.


A terminal multiplexer provides separation between where a [shell](/shells.html)
is running and where the shell is accessed. Each shell can be running on a 
different computer, but to the developer it does not matter where each 
shell is being executed.

For example, a developer could have many shells running within a 
terminal, like the following screenshot. 

<img src="/img/visuals/terminal-multiplexer-tmux.jpg" width="100%" alt="tmux terminal multiplexer with many panes." class="shot"></a>

The above terminal window is using the tmux terminal multiplexer implementation
with two windows and three panes. 


## Why are terminal multiplexers awesome?
Developers gain greater control over the usage of their shells by working
with a terminal multiplexer.

Shells are typically executed locally on a computer but terminal multiplexers 
allow one or more virtual shells to be run within a single terminal. Shells 
can also be left running within the multiplexer and attached to again from a 
different machine.

Terminal multiplexers are used by developers to run many virtual shells 
within a single terminal. These shells can be run via a mix of local, 
remote, containerized and virtualized resources. The shells can also
be persisted and moved while running from one computer to another.


### Terminal multiplexer implementations
Many terminal multiplexer implementations exist, including:

* [tmux](/tmux.html)

* [screen](/screen.html)

* byobu

* [Pymux](https://pypi.org/project/pymux)
  ([source code](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pymux)) is a
  terminal multiplexer implementation 
  written in Python that clones the functionality of [tmux](/tmux.html).
  Like tmux and [Screen](/screen.html), Pymux makes it easier for
  programmers to use many shells within a single terminal window during
  development.


### Terminal multiplexer resources
* [Terminal multiplexers](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_termmux.php)
  provides a wonderful overview of the subject, including the history
  of various implementations and why you would want to use one for
  development.

* [Terminal multiplexer commands](http://hyperpolyglot.org/multiplexers)
  is a comparison of equivalent key command in the two most popular 
  implementations, tmux and screen.

  gives solid answers on this (now closed) question of the usefulness of
  the major terminal multiplexer implementations.
