[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) 
([source code](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)) is a 
[terminal multiplexer](/terminal-multiplexers.html) implementation 
often used during Python development on Linux and macOS. tmux grants 
greater control over a programmers's 
[development environment](/development-environments.html) by making it
easier to use many shells at once and attaching to both local and remote 
[shell](/shells.html) sessions.

* [Tmux and Vim - even better together](https://blog.bugsnag.com/tmux-and-vim/)
  explains how using tmux with the [Vim](/vim.html) editor provide better
  multi-window navigation using only keystrokes and other benefits. As an avid
  tmux+Vim user myself, I can attest to how great these two tools complement
  each other.

  developer's configuration that combines [Vim](/vim.html) and several plugins
  with tmux for a productive setup.
