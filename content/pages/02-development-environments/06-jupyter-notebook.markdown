meta: Jupyter Notebook, formerly named iPython Notebook, is a powerful Python code execution environment often used for data analysis.


[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) 
([open source code](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)), which began 
as the iPython Notebook project, is a 
[development environment](/development-environments.html) for writing
and executing Python code. Jupyter Notebook is often used for exploratory 
[data analysis](/data-analysis.html) and visualization.

Project Jupyter is the top-level project name for all of the subprojects under 
development, which includes Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebooks can also run 
code for other programming languages such as [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/).


### How does Jupyter Notebook work?
The key piece of Jupyter Notebook infrastructure is a web application that
runs locally for creating and sharing documents that contain embedded code and 
execution results.

### How are IPython Notebook and Jupyter Notebook related?
IPython Notebook was the original project that proved that there was great
demand among data scientists and programmers for an interactive, repeatable
development environment. Jupyter Notebook became the new official name for the
overall project during 
[The Big Split](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7)
after the IPython Notebook project matured into distinct submodules such as the 
interactive shell, notebook document format and user interface widgets tools.
However, the IPython Notebook name sticks around as the Python backend for
Jupyter Notebook which is seriously confusing if you are searching the internet
and come across both current and old articles that use all of these names
interchangeably.


### Jupyter Notebook beginner tutorials
Jupyter Notebook's powerful analysis and visualization environment can be 
intimidating even for experienced developers that are new to the tool. The
following tutorials will explain the basics so you can quickly figure out
your own productive workflow.
