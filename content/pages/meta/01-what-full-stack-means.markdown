meta: Full stack is an ambiguous term so on this Full Stack Python page I describe its meaning and usage for this site.


The terms "full stack" and "Full Stack Python" are ambiguous but I am using
a specific definition here on this site. These term can be defined for a 
web stack either to mean

1. Every layer, from the machine code up to the browser, are written in Python 

1. Python code interacts with code written in other languages such as C and
   JavaScript to provide a complete web stack

I named this site specifically for the second definition: Python is one
programming language among many that are used to build your application 
stack. 

Some folks took the title of the site to mean Python runs everything from 
the web browser on down. That's simply not practical or possible. While Python 
is an amazing programming language, there are many tasks it does not do well.

Python is just one language among many that allows our computers to execute 
software and communicate with each other. 

For beginners, learning the syntax and libraries in Python necessary to 
build a web application or web API is a major undertaking. Even intermediate 
and advanced Python software developers need to constantly program and learn 
to keep up with our ever evolving ecosystem. I created Full Stack Python to
be just one of [many resources](/best-python-resources.html) that help Python 
developers build and maintain their programming skills.
