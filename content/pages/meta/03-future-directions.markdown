meta: The future directions page on Full Stack Python gives some insight into in-progress site enhancements.


Full Stack Python has completely blown away my expectations for what I could
accomplish with a side project. I really appreciate all of the in-person 
feedback, emails and pull requests I've received from the community. Keep 
them coming!

For 2017 I am filling in the grayed-out topics on the 
[all topics](/table-of-contents.html) page. I will also address the
tactical fixes and improvements that need to be made which are listed
in the "tactical improvements" section below.


## More updates
A huge update was released in the form of the
[The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments](http://www.deploypython.com/),
a step-by-step tutorial book for learning how to deploy Python web 
applications.

I also worked with Michael Kennedy of 
[Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm) on our 
[Python for Entrepreneurs](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business)
video course. It's fully released right now!


## Pull requests and fixes
Note that these plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!

Typos, inaccurate statements or general areas for improvement can also 
be handled through an issue ticket or pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/).

## Page maturity
There are so many pages on Full Stack Python (as shown on the
[all topics / table of contents page](/table-of-contents.html))
that many are still in active development.

There are roughly one of four buckets of "maturity" a page could fall into:

1. Not yet created: some pages do not have a detailed page although
   they will have one in the future. These pages are grayed out on
   the table of contents.
2. Starter: a bare bones explanation with a few resources. For example,
   [Jupyter Notebook](/jupyter-notebook.html) and 
   [Sublime Text](/sublime-text.html).
3. Intermediate: a page has explanations, more details on why it is 
   important along with additional context in multiple sections. Resources
   are well-curated and each link is described in further detail.
   Examples: [Jinja2](/jinja2.html) and 
   [development environments](/development-environments.html).
4. Stellar: a shining example of a well-written, detailed page that 
   contains numerous explanations and descriptions for the topic. 
   Where applicable there should be digrams and visualizations that augment
   the text to help the reader better understand the topic.
   There are also typically multiple categories of resources and links
   for further research.
   Examples: 
   [Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html),
   [PostgreSQL](/postgresql.html) and 
   [static site generators](/static-site-generator.html).


## Tactical improvements
Every page on Full Stack Python is a work-in-progress that can always
use improvements. The following items on this list need some love and 
attention.

* Update newer pages such as [AWS Lambda](/aws-lambda.html), 
  [Text editors and IDEs](/text-editors-ides.html) and
  [Falcon](/falcon.html) pages with additional sections and resources.

* [RQ](/redis-queue-rq.html): Add "Comparing Celery and RQ" and 
  "when is RQ useful?" sections.

* [Celery](/celery.html): Add graphics to show how Celeryd and Celerybeat
  work. Also add section on comparing Celery to other task queues.

* [Apache Cassandra](/apache-cassandra.html): Add "why use cassandra?"
  and "what is CQL?" sections.

* [MongoDB](/mongodb.html): Add "why is mongodb useful?" and 
  "database drivers" sections.

* [Redis](/redis.html): Add "why use redis?", "data drivers" sections.

* [Git](/git.html): Add "why use git?", "what is a distributed version 
  control system?", "what's the difference between git and github?" and 
  "git clients" sections.
