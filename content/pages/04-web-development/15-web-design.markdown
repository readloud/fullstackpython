Web design is the creation of a web application's style and user interaction
using CSS and JavaScript.


## Why is web design important?
You wouldnâ€™t use a web application that looked like the following screenshot, 
would you?

<img src="/img/visuals/no-style-webpage.png" width="100%" alt="HTML with no CSS or JavaScript." class="shot rnd outl"> 

Creating web pages with their own style and interactivity so users can easily
accomplish their tasks is a major part of building modern web applications.


## Getting started if you have no "eye" for design
Design can feel like something "creative" people understand intuitively,
but like all skills design is something that can be learned. Some people
are faster learners in design just like some folks are quicker in
picking up programming. But anyone can learn how to be a better designer
by learning the basic principles and practicing them.

One of the best mental models for basic design is C.R.A.P., which helped me 
grasp why some designs look good while others do not. CRAP is an acronym
for:

    * Contrast: noticeable differences from one element to another
    * Repetition: elements' consistency
    * Alignment: order among all elements
    * Proximity: placement between elements and how they are organized

These basic principles all you to start breaking down the problem into
digestible pieces that you can work on rather than feeling like you
"just don't have an eye for design".


## Designing for various screen sizes
Separating the content from the rules for how to display the content allows 
devices to render the output differently based on factors such as screen size
and device type. Displaying content differently based on varying screen 
attributes is often called *responsive design*. The responsiveness is 
accomplished by implementing
[media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries)
in the [CSS](/cascading-style-sheets.html). 

For example, a mobile device does not have as much space to display a 
navigation bar on the side of a page so it is often pushed down 
below the main content. The 
[Bootstrap Blog example](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) 
shows that navigation bar relocation scenario when you resize the browser 
width.


## Fantastic design resources
There are way too many design resources on the web, so I picked out
this short list as my absolute favorites that help developers become
(hopefully much) better with design.

* [Clean up your mess: A Guide to Visual Design for Everyone](http://www.visualmess.com/index.html)
  walks through the basic principles for clean and effective design. You
  can make a website go from terrible to well-designed often by following
  a few principles on spacing, alignment, contrast and repetition of
  page elements.

* [Resilient web design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/) is an incredible
  online book that teaches how to create websites that are accessible to
  every reader and look great while doing it.

* [Design 101 for Developers](https://academy.realm.io/posts/christopher-downer-design-101-for-developers/)
  gives away the "secrets" to good design that designers follow but that
  can be similarly accessible to developers who understand what they want
  their design to accomplish.

* [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) provides a beautiful overview of 
  design principles for building user experiences. Highly recommended even
  if just to see how the information is presented.

* [Building your color palette](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/)
  explains why color pickers are not useful for most user interfaces
  and how you should actually go about selecting your color palette
  for a real world application.

  could offer a dark mode design to their users.

* [A short history of body copy sizes on the Web](https://fvsch.com/body-copy-sizes/)
  provides a useful examination of how originally the web's typography 
  mirrored what was in traditional print. Eventually, the designs shifted
  upwards in font size because screen resolutions changed. However, even
  in 2020 there is no consensus for what font size to use in various
  situations so designers simply have to do what they've always done and
  try their sites on various devices and screen sizes.

* [Web bloat](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/) is the story of traveling
  and using the web with low bandwidth, high latency internet connections 
  that often drop packets. The author explains how many websites are 
  barely usable and that if you truly want your site to work well you need
  to ensure it works for connections much worse than the fiber connection
  you may have at the home or office.

* [Fundamental design principles for non-designers](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/fundamental-design-principles-for-non-designers-ad34c30caa7)
  summarizes numerous design tips into four principles that those without
  prior design knowledge can follow. The author gives a bunch of great 
  examples and further details for the four principles, which are contrast, 
  consistency, Occam's Razor and space.

  a collection of websites from between 1991 and 2006 that show the evolution
