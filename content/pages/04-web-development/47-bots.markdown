meta: Bots are applications that combine text input with contextual data to handle and respond to requests.


Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically 
provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment 
information, to appropriately handle the request and respond. Bots are
often also called "chatbots", "assistants" or "agents."


### Open source bot examples
* [Limbo](https://github.com/llimllib/limbo) is an awesome Slack chatbot 
  that provides a base for Python code that otherwise would require 
  boilerplate to handle the Slack API events firehose.

* [python-rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot) is the bot
  framework for building Slack bots with the Real Time Messaging (RTM) API
  over [WebSockets](/websockets.html).

* The 
  [GitHub bots search results](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=bots)
  and the [bots GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/bots) contain tens of
  thousands of example bots you take analyze to see how they are built.

* [Errbot](http://errbot.io/en/latest/) can work with 
  [multiple backends](http://errbot.io/en/latest/features.html) such
  as Hipchat, Discord, Slack and Telegram. It's designed to be deployed
  "as is" except for your credentials but the 
  [Python source code](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot) 
  can also be customized.


### Python-specific bot resources
* [How to Buid an SMS Slack Bot](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/05/build-sms-slack-bot-python.html)
  is a tutorial on using 
  [SMS text messages](/blog/send-sms-text-messages-python.html) 
  to communicate with a Slack bot that can post and receive messages. The
  bot is a good base for a more complicated Slack bot that could use
  natural language processing or other more advanced parsing techniques.
  Either Python 2 or 3 can be used 
  [with the code which is also available on GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/slack-api-python-examples).

* [Dropbox open sourced their security Slack bot](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/02/meet-securitybot-open-sourcing-automated-security-at-scale/),
  which is [built in Python](https://github.com/dropbox/securitybot).
  The bot converses with a user when backend systems detect strange behavior on
  one of their accounts to check if there has been a security breach.
