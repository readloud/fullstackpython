## Projects with pandas Example Code
The following active projects use the [pandas](/pandas.html) data analysis
library in various ways that can show you how to inspect your own data sets
and build your own applications.


### 100-pandas-puzzles
[100 pandas puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles) is a project with
100 exercises that test knowledge of pandas' functionality. The project contains two
[Jupyter Notebooks](/jupyter-notebook.html), one with 
[just the puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles/blob/master/100-pandas-puzzles.ipynb) 
and the other with 
[both puzzles and solutions](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles/blob/master/100-pandas-puzzles-with-solutions.ipynb).

The project is provided as open source under the 
[MIT license](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles/blob/master/LICENSE).


### data-science-ipython-notebooks
[data-science-ipython-notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks)
is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks including a folder with
[pandas code examples](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/tree/master/pandas).

### pandas-videos
[Python pandas Q&A video series](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos) contains the
Python code that pairs with 
[Kevin Markham's video series on data analysis with pandas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y).
The repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks, including ones on
[the top pandas tricks](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos/blob/master/top_25_pandas_tricks.ipynb),
[merging DataFrames](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos/blob/master/pandas_merge.ipynb),
and
[using MultiIndex](https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos/blob/master/pandas_multiindex.ipynb).


### ved-explore
[ved-explore](https://github.com/joaofig/ved-explore) is a set of open source
Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate analysis of the 
[Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02081). The project 
is provided as open source under the 
[MIT license](https://github.com/joaofig/ved-explore/blob/master/LICENSE).
