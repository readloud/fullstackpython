## Example Projects with Great Example Code

various ways that can show you how to build your own applications.


### dccnsys

system built with [Django](/django.html). The code is open source under the

is a Python tool to aggregate clinically relevant information related 
to variants in the DMD gene and display that [data](/data.html) to a user 
with a [Django](/django.html) web application.


### Django REST Framework Action Serializer
[drf-action-serializer](https://github.com/gregschmit/drf-action-serializer)
([PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/drf-action-serializer/))
is an extension for [Django REST Framework](/django-rest-framework-drf.html)
that makes it easier to configure specific serializers to use based on the
client's request action. For example, a list view should have one serializer
whereas the detail view would have a different serializer.
