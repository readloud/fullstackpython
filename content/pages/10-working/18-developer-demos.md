meta: How to give technical demos to software developers.


Creating and executing an appealing technical demo to an audience of software
developers is a ton of work, but there is no better way to get people 
legitimately interested in your product if you land a great demo with
an appropriate audience. The inherent difficulty involved in exceptional 
technical demos also creates a large barrier that prevent others from simply 
copying your work, which can happen with technical blog content.

To achieve a standout technical demo you must:

1. show how to easily solve a difficult technical problem
1. speak plainly but accurately
1. do it live, including writing code if required
1. tell a story with a narrative arc
1. rehearse constantly, both the happy path and recovering from errors
