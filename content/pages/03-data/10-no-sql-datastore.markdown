meta: NoSQL data stores persistent data in different ways than traditional relational databases. Learn more about NoSQL on Full Stack Python.


Relational databases store the vast majority of web application
persistent data. However, there are several alternative classifications of
storage representations.

1. Key-value pair
1. Document-oriented
1. Column-family table
1. Graph

These persistent data storage representations are commonly used to augment,
rather than completely replace, relational databases. The underlying
persistence type used by the NoSQL database often gives it different
performance characteristics than a relational database, with better results
on some types of read/writes and worse performance on others.


## Key-value Pair
Key-value pair data stores are based
on [hash map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) data structures.


### Key-value pair data stores
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) is an open source in-memory key-value pair data
  store. Redis is often called "the Swiss Army Knife of web application
  development." It can be used for caching, queuing, and storing session data
  for faster access than a traditional relational database, among many other
  use cases. Learn more on the [Redis page](/redis.html).
  
* [Memcached](http://www.memcached.org/) is another widely used in-memory
  key-value pair storage system.

## Document-oriented
A document-oriented database provides a semi-structured representation for
nested data.


### Document-oriented data stores
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is an open source document-oriented
  data store with a Binary Object Notation (BSON) storage format that is
  JSON-style and familiar to web developers.
  [PyMongo](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/python/) is a
  commonly used client for interfacing with one or more MongoDB
  instances through Python code. [MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org/)
  is a Python ORM specifically written for MongoDB that is built on top
  of PyMongo.

* [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/) is an open source distributed data store
  focused on availability, fault tolerance and large scale deployments.

* [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is also an open source project
  where the focus is on embracing RESTful-style HTTP access for working with
  stored JSON data.

  shows how to use Python to interface with MongoDB via PyMongo and MongoEngine.


## Column-family table
A column-family table class of NoSQL data stores builds on the key-value
pair type. Each key-value pair is considered a row in the store while the
column family is similar to a table in the relational database model.


### Column-family table data stores
* [Apache Cassandra](/apache-cassandra.html)

* Apache [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/)



## Graph
A graph database represents and stores data in three aspects: nodes, edges
and properties.

A *node* is an entity, such as a person or business.

An *edge* is the relationship between two entities. For example, an
edge could represent that a node for a person entity is an employee of a
business entity.

A *property* represents information about nodes. For example, an entity
representing a person could have a property of "female" or "male".


### Graph data stores
* [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/) is one of the most widely used graph
  databases and runs on the Java Virtual Machine stack.

* [Cayley](https://github.com/google/cayley) is an open source graph data
  store written by Google primarily written in Go.

* [Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/) is a distributed graph
  database built for multi-node clusters.

  versus CA and high availability in large scale deployments.

* [NoSQL Weekly](http://www.nosqlweekly.com/) is a free curated email
  newsletter that aggregates articles, tutorials, and videos about
  non-relational data stores.

* Relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL have added features in
  more recent versions that mimic some of the capabilities of NoSQL data
  stores. For example, check out this blog post on
  [storing JSON data in PostgreSQL](https://blog.codeship.com/unleash-the-power-of-storing-json-in-postgres/).


## NoSQL data stores learning checklist
1. Understand why NoSQL data stores are better for some use cases than
   relational databases. In general these benefits are only seen at large
   scale so they may not be applicable to your web application.

1. Integrate Redis into your project for a speed boost over slower persistent
   storage. Storing session data in memory is generally much faster than
   saving that data in a traditional relational database that uses persistent
   storage. Note that when memory is flushed the data goes away so anything
   that needs to be persistent must still be backed up to disk on a regular
   basis.

1. Evaluate other use cases such as storing transient logs in a
   document-oriented data store such as MongoDB.
