### d3.js tutorials
d3.js has a steep learning curve so it is a good idea to read several 
tutorials before diving in and trying to create your own visualization
from scratch.

* [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to d3.js](https://medium.com/@enjalot/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-d3-js-a8552174733a)
  is a wonderfully-written resource that explains the context for how
  d3.js works and how all the pieces can be used to create your desired
  visualizations.

* [d3.js first steps](https://www.dashingd3js.com/d3js-first-steps)
  contains the code and markup for building your first d3.js visual.

* [Let's Make a D3 Plugin](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/d3-plugin/) shows
  you how to create your own reusable plugin that you can use across
  multiple visualizations as a separate JavaScript library. d3.js 
  version 4 is now widely used so don't worry about the note at the
  start of the article.

* [Reusable and extendable d3 charts](https://537.io/reusable-and-extendable-d3-charts/)
  is a natural extension of the d3 plugin post. It shows how to reuse
  visualization code between multiple visuals.

* [Visualizing Movement Data - Part I](https://omid.al/posts/2016-08-23-MocapVis-D3.html)
  provides a detailed example of how to draw a complex visualization.

* This [Fantasy Map Generator](https://bl.ocks.org/Azgaar/b845ce22ea68090d43a4ecfb914f51bd)
  is such a cool example of what d3.js can procedurally generate based on 
  a set of inputs.

* [Building dashboards with Django and D3](http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/building-dashboards-with-django-and-d3/)

* [Argyle](http://bl.ocks.org/veltman/f24fba4f6549639cacfd4d0a50e9d4b8) in
  d3? Oh yes, the library can do that, and here is the code to prove it.

* [How and why to use D3 with React](https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-use-d3-with-react-d239eb1ea274)
  is an awesome overview of the D3.js plugin ecosystem and how to use
  the tool with a React-based JavaScript front end.

* [D3 is not a data visualization library](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/d3-is-not-a-data-visualization-library-67ba549e8520)
  breaks down the parts to D3 and why it's not directly comparable to 
  a typical charting library.


### Charts with d3.js
* [Responsive D3js Charts](http://ablesense.com/responsive-d3js-charts/)
  shows how to take a static line chart and make it 
  [responsive](/responsive-design.html) when the browser size changes.

* [Resize to Scale with d3.js](http://www.thesoftwaresimpleton.com/blog/2015/11/16/resize-d3/)
  gives code for a render function that adjusts the size of the viewing
  window based on the parent element for the visualization.

* [Responsive Data Visualization](http://nrabinowitz.github.io/rdv/)
  provides another approach for making responsive D3.js charts.

* [Make great-looking d3.js charts in Python without coding a line of JavaScript](http://dataviztalk.blogspot.com/2016/01/make-great-looking-d3js-charts-in.html)
  combines a Python backend with the 
  [python-nvd3](https://github.com/areski/python-nvd3) library to
  generate d3.js charts without having to hand-write the JavaScript code.
  If you are interested in a solution like this for your own visualizations
  then you should also check out [Bokeh](/bokeh.html).

* [How to make a modern dashboard with NVD3.js](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-a-modern-dashboard-with-nvd3-js/)
  uses the [NVD3.js](http://nvd3.org/) library that works as an
  abstraction on top of d3.js to create charts. The post puts together
  several charts to show how to build a dashboard based on public JSON
  data.

* [d3-regression](https://observablehq.com/@harrystevens/introducing-d3-regression)
  is a module for calculating statistical regressions from two-dimensionala
  data.


### D3 ecosystem
* [The trouble with D3](https://medium.com/@enjalot/the-trouble-with-d3-4a84f7de011f)
  is not a tutorial but it's an important read because it discusses why
  D3 can be very difficult to learn: the learning curve depends on your
  background. If you are a front-end developer you will likely have the
  easiest time if you already understand [JavaScript](/javascript.html),
  SVG and the browser Document Object Model (DOM). Non-technical designers
  and analysts typically have the hardest time with using D3 because the
  not only have to learn the tool itself but all the concepts and 
  web browser technologies that it is built upon. 

* This 
  [visualization of d3.js modules and resources](https://wattenberger.com/blog/d3)
  is a wonderful map for understanding how various parts of the library
  and the ecosystem fit together. The visual provides a useful map for where
  to concentrate your learning depending on what type of visualization you
  are working to build.

* [D3.js in Action, Second Edition](https://blog.usejournal.com/d3-js-in-action-second-edition-8cf7ffa2a116)
  is partially an announcement for the authors book but also contains
  good context for who uses D3 and why its usage continues to grow.
