### Example Ansible playbooks
Ansible is far easier to learn when you can read how more full-featured 
playbooks are built using many tasks. An interesting note from my own 
experience is that when you get more experienced using Ansible there are
many shortcuts in the task syntax so you can often make playbooks that have
fewer lines of code than when you were less experienced yet the readability
does not suffer. 

Check out some of these example playbooks to learn more about how you may
be able to structure your playbooks:

* The 
  [prod directory](https://github.com/mattmakai/fsp-deployment-guide/tree/master/prod) 
  under the 
  [Full Stack Python Deployment Guide open source project code](https://github.com/mattmakai/fsp-deployment-guide)
  contains a full playbook for deploying a standard [Nginx](/nginx.html),
  [Gunicorn](/green-unicorn-gunicorn.html) and [PostgreSQL](/postgresql.html)
  stack.

* [mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook)
  configures macOS with various applications and developer tools such as
  [Docker](/docker.html), Homebrew and [Sublime Text](/sublime-text.html).
