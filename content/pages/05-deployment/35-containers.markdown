meta: Containers are a concept where processes are run isolated on a operating system.


Containers are an [operating system](/operating-systems.html)-level 
isolation mechanism for running processes and other system resources from
other containers and the base system.


## Are containers new?
Containers are not conceptually new, dating back to around the 1970s, but
they gained rapid adoption starting in 2012 when several Linux distributions
began integrating containers tools generally made it more practical to
use them. Previously, to use containers a developer would need to use a
less common operating system or distribution customized with some sort of
virtual machine feature. Using containers was basically not supported in typical
deployment scenarios.


### Containers history and introduction
The following resources do a great job of explaining where the containers
concept came from, how they differ from virtual machines and why they are
useful.

* [The Missing Introduction To Containerization](https://medium.com/faun/the-missing-introduction-to-containerization-de1fbb73efc5)
  truly grants what its title sets out to do: give a wide-ranging overview
  and history of container concepts and tools. The post is dense but well
  worth the read to start learning about `chroot`, Solaris zones, LXC,
  [Docker](/docker.html) and how they've influenced each other throughout
  the past 40 years.

* [A brief history of containers](https://mesosphere.com/blog/brief-history-containers/)
  has some solid context for why containers have taken off in the last
  several years, including the integration of operating system container
  virtualization in most distributions as well as the creation of management 
  tools such as [Docker](/docker.html), Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and 
  Mesosphere.

* [Setting the Record Straight: containers vs. Zones vs. Jails vs. VMs](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/)
  compares and contrasts the designs of Linux containers, zones, jails
  and virtual machines. Containers typically take advantage of primitives
  but are more complicated because they have more individual parts put
  together while zones and jails are designed as top-level operating
  system components. There are advantages and disadvantages of these
  approaches that you should understand as you use each one.

* [Containers and Distributed Systems: Where They Came From and Where Theyâ€™re Going](https://mesosphere.com/blog/containers-distributed-systems/)
  is an interview that digs into the past, present and future of
  containers based on the experience of Chuck McManis who has worked
  on building jails and other process isolation abstractions into
  operating systems.

* [Linux containers in a few lines of code](https://zserge.com/posts/containers/)
  shows how containers work by providing some code to run a busybox
  Docker image but without using docker. It then explains what's
  happening under the hood as you run basic commands such as `/bin/sh`.

* [A Practical Introduction to Container Terminology](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction/)
  has both some solid introductory information on containers as well as
  a good description of terms such as container host, registry server,
  image layer, orchestration and many others that come up frequently
  when using containers.

* [Containers from scratch](https://ericchiang.github.io/post/containers-from-scratch/)
  explains how Linux features such as `cgroups`, `chroot` and namespaces
  are used by container implementations.

* [Container networking is simple](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/)
  shows that container networking is nothing more than a simple combination
  of the well-known Linux facilities such as network namespaces, virtual 
  Ethernet devices (veth), virtual network switches (bridge) and
  IP routing and network address translation (NAT).

* [Running containers without Docker](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/26/running-container-without-docker/)
  reviews a migration path for an organization that already has a bunch of
  infrastructure but sees advantages in using containers. However, the 
  author explains why you can use containers without Docker even if you
  eventually plan to use Docker, Kubernetes or other container tools and
  orchestration layer.

* [Datadog's 2020 Container Report](https://www.datadoghq.com/container-report/)
  contains some interesting statistics about container usage across
  their customer base, such as [Kubernetes](/kubernetes.html) adoption
  and container deployments by cloud platform.

* [mocker](https://github.com/tonybaloney/mocker) is a Docker imitation
  open source project written in all Python which is intended for learning
  purposes.


### Working with containers
You can get started using containers once you understand some of the 
terminology and work through a couple of introductory tutorials like the ones
listed above. Check out the below resources when you want to do more advanced 
configurations and dig deeper into how containers work.

* [Linux containers in 500 lines of code](https://blog.lizzie.io/linux-containers-in-500-loc.html)
  is a bonkers in-depth post about building your own simplified, but not 
  simple version of Docker to learn how it works.

* [A Comparison of Linux Container Images](http://crunchtools.com/comparison-linux-container-images/)
  presents data on many of the frequently-used base container images.

* [7 best practices for building containers](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/7-best-practices-for-building-containers.html)
  provides Google's recommendations for creating containers such as 
  include only a single application per container, make sure to use
  descriptive tags and build the smallest image size possible.

* [Building healthier containers](https://blog.kintoandar.com/2018/01/Building-healthier-containers.html)
  examines how [Docker containers](/docker.html) are different from 
  virtual machines and digs into dependencies that can be included in
  your container image if you do not know how to properly build them.

* [Containers patterns](https://l0rd.github.io/containerspatterns/)
  covers common usage patterns that have developed now that containers
  have been in development workflows for a few years.


### Container security resources
Container security is a hot topic because there are so many ways of screwing
it up, just like any infrastructure that runs your applications. These
resources explain security considerations specific to containers.

* [A Practical Introduction to Container Security](https://cloudberry.engineering/article/practical-introduction-container-security/)
  examines security at build time for projects and how to
  minimize the risk of supply chain attack. It then goes into
  infrastructure and runtime security where you need to understand
  different attack vectors and minimize malicious attempts against
  your containers during these phases..

* [Building Container Images Securely on Kubernetes](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/building-container-images-securely-on-kubernetes/)
  discusses some of the issues with building containers and why the
  author created [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img) as a tool
  to help solve the problems she was seeing.
 
* [Making security invisible](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x0DfyC8OxTHsiqf6YRGmqS63CjqCs8-613T_Dzdyi0Q/mobilepresent?slide=id.p)
  is a great presentation that covers sandboxes, Seccomp and other
  concepts for isolating potentially unsafe code to limit attack scope.

* [10 layers of Linux container security](https://opensource.com/article/17/10/10-layers-container-security)
  explains many of the attack vectors you need to be aware of when you
  are working with containers.
